This code performs a complete analysis of the Abalone dataset. It begins by importing essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and visualize age distribution and correlations. Data preprocessing involves converting categorical values in the 'Sex' column to numerical format and creating an 'Age' column. The data is then split into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is trained, predictions are made, and the model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics, concluding with a visualization of actual versus predicted ages.
